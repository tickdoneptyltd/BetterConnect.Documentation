# Addresses



### Billing Addresses

Billing addresses are linked to whom the final invoice will be sent to. It is important to recognise the billing address flag on the address set up screen. Billing address has additional options that can be configured, including such things as the default fuel levy, a default management fee and also other default fees.

It is important that you set up the correct mailing and email address for the system to operate correctly.

### Delivery Addresses

Delivery addresses are a simpler implementation of billing address. None of the billing address fields apply such as fuel levy and additional fees.

Delivery addresses will appear in any drop-down the application that indicate a pickup from more delivery to address.
